## About Trail Tracker

This application is being designed as a proof of concept way of crowd sourcing maintenance of multi use trails.  The initial goal is to provide a system to view and act on maintenance tasks.  Task can be generated from user submissions (Downed Tree), or by a schedule (Empty Garbage).
